Title: Swapping two variables using XOR
Date: October 23, 2025

<p>We all have used XOR method to swap two variables without using extra(third) variable. But do you really know how it is working internally?</p>
<p>In this blog, I am dimistfying it's internal.</p>
<p>Before jumping into it directly we must be familiar with the XOR properties.</p>
<code>
    <pre>
        X ^ X => 0
        0 ^ X => X
    </pre>
</code>
<p>Keeping above rules in mind let's swap variables</p>
<code>
    <pre>
        X = a
        Y = b

        X = X ^ Y
        Y = X ^ Y
        X = X ^ Y  
    </pre>
</code>
