Title: Swapping two variables using XOR
Date: October 23, 2025

<p>We all have used XOR method to swap two variables without using extra(third) variable. But do you really know how does it working internally?</p>
<p>In this blog, I am demystifying it's internal.</p>
<p>Before jumping into it directly we must be familiar with the XOR properties.</p>
<code>
    <pre>
    X ^ X => 0
    0 ^ X => X
    </pre>
</code>
<p>Keeping above rules in mind let's swap variables</p>
<code>
    <pre>
    X = a
    Y = b

    X = X ^ Y
     Here X becomes, X = a ^ b
    Y = X ^ Y
     Here Y becomes, Y = (a ^ b) ^ b ∵ substituting value of X
     Y = a ^ (b ^ b) ∵ rearranging
     Y = a ^ 0 ∵ from the 1st rule listed above
     Y = a ∵ from the 2nd rule listed above

     ∴ Y = a
    X = X ^ Y
     Here X becomes, X = (a ^ b) ^ (a) ∵ substituting value of X and Y
     X = (a ^ a) ^ b ∵ rearranging
     Y = 0 ^ b ∵ from the 1st rule listed above
     Y = b ∵ from the 2nd rule listed above

     ∴ X = b
    </pre>
