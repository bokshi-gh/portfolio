<p>In life, Even if we did everything right, we can still lose. seems unfair, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>There is no superior entity deciding what's fair or unfair, what's right or wrong.</p>
<p>The universe doesn't know we exist and it never cared.</p>
<p>We think hard work always pays off, practice makes us perfect and leads to the success. But it doesn't. It only increases the probability, not the certainty.</p>
<p>We believe we praise Elon Musk or Einstein because of their brilliancy and hard work. But that's not the full truth. We praise them because they achieved success and got results.</p>
<p>As humans, we don’t judge hard work by the effort put in we judge it by the outcome.</p>
<p>Who knows how many equally or more hardworking, brilliant people than Elon or Einstein are dying every year, living in poverty, depression, and being forgotten?</p>
<p>Even if their efforts were the same or greater, they are ignored simply because they didn’t get the results.</p>
<p>Because no one cares about your story until you win.</p>
<p>Even though life is unfair, you know what is fair?</p>
<p>Death. Einstein died. And Elon will too.</p>
