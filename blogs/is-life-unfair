<p>In life, Even if we did everything right, we can still lose. seems unfair, right?</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p>There is no superior entity deciding what's fair or unfair, what's right or wrong.</p>

<p>The universe doesn't know we exist and it never really cared.</p>

<p>We think hard work always pays off, practice makes us perfect and leads us to success. But it doesn't. It only increases the probability, not the certainty.</p>

<p>We believe we praise Elon Musk or Einstein because of their brilliancy and hard work. But that's not the full truth. We praise them because they got results.</p>

<p>As humans, we don’t judge hard work by the effort put in we judge it by the outcome.</p>

<p>Who knows how many equally or more hardworking, brilliant people than Elon or Einstein are dying every year, living in poverty, depression, and totally being forgotten as if they never existed?</p>

<p>Even if their efforts were the same or greater, they are ignored simply because they didn’t get the results.</p>

<p>I think it is because no one cares about your story until you win.</p>

<p>Even though life is unfair, do you know what thing is actually fair?</p>

<p>Death. Einstein died. And Elon will too.</p>
